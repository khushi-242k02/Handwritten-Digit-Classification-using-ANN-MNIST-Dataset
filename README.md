# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-ANN-MNIST-Dataset
This project involves training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of 28x28 pixels. The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies each digit, showcasing the capabilities of neural networks in image recognition tasks.
